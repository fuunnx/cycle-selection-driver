function main (sources) {
  const vdom$ = sources.Selection.selections()
    .startWith(null)
    .map(selection => div([
      p('This is a regular paragraph with text you can select.'),
      p(
        { attrs: { contentEditable: true } },
        'This is an editable region with text you can select.'
      ),

      )

run(main, {
  DOM: makeDOMDriver('.app'),
  Selection: selectionDriver
});

## API

### `selectionDriver()`

A readonly Cycle.js driver that returns a `SelectionSource`

### `SelectionSource`

A Cycle.js source that provides access to user selections.

#### Methods

`.selections()`

Returns a stream of `Selection` objects. The current `Selection` will be emitted each time the [`selectionchange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/selectionchange) event is fired.

### `Selection`

A [`Selection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection) object representing the range of text selected by the user or the current position of the caret.

It is recommended that you avoid using the mutational methods of the `Selection` object because doing so would constitute as a side effect. Although the `selectionDriver` is currently readonly, it could be updated in the future to accept a sink that would allow mutations to the current selection.
